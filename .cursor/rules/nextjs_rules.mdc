# Next.js Guidelines

## Project Structure

- Use the App Router (`app/` directory) for all routing
- Place reusable components in `components/` directory
- Store utility functions in `lib/` directory
- Keep hooks in `hooks/` directory
- Use TypeScript for all files

## Component Guidelines

- Export components as default exports
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the structure: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Minimize comments in code
- Use proper TypeScript types for props and state

## Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Import global styles from `app/globals.css`
- Use CSS modules or styled-components sparingly
- Follow the design system defined in `components/ui/`

## State Management

- Use React hooks for local state
- Use Convex for server state and real-time data
- Wrap the app with `ConvexClientProvider` for Convex integration
- Use Clerk for authentication

## Performance

- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Implement proper loading states
- Use React.memo for expensive components when needed
- Leverage Next.js built-in optimizations

## File Naming

- Use kebab-case for file names
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use camelCase for function and variable names
- Group related components in subdirectories

## Import/Export

- Use named imports for utilities and types
- Use default exports for components
- Group imports: React, external libraries, internal components, types
- Use absolute imports from the root when possible
